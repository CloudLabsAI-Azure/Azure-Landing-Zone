# Azure Landing Zones

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you will **deploy an Azure Landing Zone (ALZ)** with **Management Groups (MGs) and Subscriptions** to establish a well-structured cloud environment. You will utilize the **App Service ALZ Accelerator** for a **secure and scalable** App Service deployment, ensuring best practices for workload hosting. Additionally, you will implement **Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA)** for **proactive monitoring and alerting**, helping to maintain system health. Governance and security controls will be enforced by applying **Azure Policies, role-based access control (RBAC), and compliance measures**. You will also deploy and secure an **application workload** within a new **App Landing Zone (LZ) subscription** while configuring **Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and operational dashboards** to gain visibility into system performance and security.

## Objective
